# Q-Tables Directory

## Overview
This directory stores Q-tables generated by the Q-learning and SARSA algorithms for the wall navigation reinforcement learning project. It also includes a Python script to convert binary Q-table files (`.npy`) into human-readable text files (`.txt`) for analysis.

## Contents
- `qlearn_qtable.npy`: Binary Q-table file for the Q-learning algorithm.
- `sarsa_qtable.npy`: Binary Q-table file for the SARSA algorithm.
- `qlearn_qtable.txt`: Human-readable text representation of the Q-learning Q-table.
- `sarsa_qtable.txt`: Human-readable text representation of the SARSA Q-table.
- `convert_qtable_to_txt.py`: Python script to convert `.npy` Q-tables to `.txt` format.

## Dependencies
To run the conversion script, ensure the following Python packages are installed:
- `numpy`
- `argparse` (included in Python standard library)

Install `numpy` using:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-numpy
```

## Usage
The `convert_qtable_to_txt.py` script converts a Q-table from `.npy` format to a human-readable `.txt` file. The output text file lists states and their corresponding Q-values for actions: Forward, Forward_Left, Forward_Right, Rotate_Left, and Rotate_Right.

## Command Example
Convert a Q-table file to text:
```bash
python3 convert_qtable_to_txt.py qlearn_qtable.npy qlearn_qtable.txt
```

## Notes
* The script expects the input .npy file to exist in the directory.
* The output .txt file is written to the same directory with sorted states for consistency.
* Each line in the output .txt file represents a state and its Q-values for the five possible actions.
